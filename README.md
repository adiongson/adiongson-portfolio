Welcome to my GitHub Data Science & Analysis Portfolio! 

![Angy's Portfolio](adiongson-portfolio)


This repository showcases my case studies emphasizing my data science and analytics using programming such as R, Python, and visualization tools like Tableau! Here's to curiosity and building more. Cheers!


# Table of Contents:
 - Cannabis Use and Poverty Levels
 - Cyclistic Case Study R
 - Travels timeline Plotly
 - Accenture Case Study

# I. Cannabis Use and Poverty Levels
 I investigated if there was a link betweeen lower poverty levels and increased cannabis use; having seen an increased amount of cannabis dispensaries in my state since legalization.
 
# II. Cyclistic Case Study R
Cyclistic, a hypothetical and fictitious bike-share company is at the core of this analysis. I, a hypothetical junior data analyst, uncover consumer insights and make recommendations  to drive traffic.

# III. Travels Timeline Plotly
I use Plotly in Python to visualize memorable travels.

# IV. Accenture Social Buzz Case Study
I provide data analytics insight through visualization on Google Sheets for Social Buzz on user metrics and preference.

# V. 1990 U.S Housing in California - Comparing Machine Learning Methods: k-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network
Using the 1990 1990 U.S Housing in California dataset, I compare machine learning methods: k-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network to determine the most ideal and efficient method to predict housing prices based on 9 features.
